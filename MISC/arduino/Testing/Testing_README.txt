These are development code, basically failed tests
0 was the original. It compiles and executes, but I
made a mistake with the way I did the ros spin thing.

Anyway 1 through 4 are all failed attempts to see the limit
of what can be processed per loop & interrupt

maybe helpful to see what I was trying to do idk
